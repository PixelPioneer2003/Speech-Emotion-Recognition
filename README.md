# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition using TESS Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** system using Deep Learning. The goal is to classify emotional states from speech signals, a critical component for emotionally intelligent systems like AI assistants, healthcare bots, and human-computer interaction tools.

The project uses the **Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS)**, which provides high-quality emotional speech samples recorded by two actresses portraying seven distinct emotions.

### Dataset Description

- A set of **200 target words** were spoken using the phrase:  
  `"Say the word _"`
- Recordings were made by **two actresses**, aged **26** and **64**.
- Each word was spoken in **seven emotional states**:
  - `anger`
  - `disgust`
  - `fear`
  - `happiness`
  - `pleasant surprise`
  - `sadness`
  - `neutral`
- A total of **2800 audio recordings** in `.wav` format.
